## Preamble

### File options

First we specify the command line options that should be supplied to the Agda compiler / interpreter when this script is processed. These are supplied in a specially formatted comment block.

In the following code we've set the following options:
* `--without-K` disables Streicher’s K axiom, which we don’t want for univalent mathematics. We'll explain why later.
* `--exact-split` makes Agda to only accept definitions with the equality sign “=” that behave like so-called judgmental or definitional equalities.
* `--safe` disables features that may make Agda inconsistent, such as `--type-in-type`, postulates and more.

```agda
{-# OPTIONS --without-K --exact-split --safe #-}
```

### Module declaration and imports

Every module file must start with a `module` stanza.

```agda
module exercises-week1 where
```

**Note:** the `module-name` must match the base of the file name `module-name.lagda.md`. The extension `.lagda.md` tells Agda that this is a **literate file** written in the markup language [Markdown](https://markdown.org). The contents of the file itself is intended to be a human readable document, with Agda code interspersed throughout and enclosed **fenced code blocks**. These start with \`\`\` or \`\`\`agda on its own line, and end with \`\`\`, also on its own line

Next we import any modules that contain Adga code that this module depends upon.

```agda
open import Agda.Primitive public
```
Here the:

* `open` directive tells Agda that we want to refer to the definitions exported by the imported module using their simple declared names, rather than prefix them with the path `Agda.Primitive.`.
* `public` modifer specifies that the definitions imported by this stanza should be re-exported to any modules that import this one.

## Code

### Standard definitions

This following code sets up the notation for the **universes** `UU i` which are _types of types_ Formally, `UU` is a function which takes as input a **level** `i : Level` and produces `UU i`, the type of types of level at most i. 

To avoid Russell's paradox, the type `UU i` is a type of the next universe level `UU (lsuc i).

**The takeway:** to declare that "`A` is a type of arbitrary universe level" write `A : UU i` in a context where `i : Level`.

```agda 
UU : (i : Level) → Set (lsuc i)
UU i = Set i
```
